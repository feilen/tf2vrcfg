---------------------Feilen's TF2 Highquality Script------------------------
Heavily modified based off of Chris' FPS configs Highquality script.
Intended to give a very high quality VR experience, only sacrificing
features that don't look good in VR.
Note: If you've used highframes or other Chris' FPS configs in the past,
it may be neccesary to go clean out leftover settings from config.cfg
(or you'll get graphical glitches, things dissapearing, etc)
